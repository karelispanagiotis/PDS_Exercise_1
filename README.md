# Vantage-Point Tree (vp-tree) construction in pthreads, cilk and openmp
_Exercise for Parallel & Distributed Systems course, school of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki._

**The Vantage-Point** Tree is a data structure used to perform the _k_ nearest neighbour search (**_kNN_**) of a query set inside a corpus set. The vptree is composed by the points of corpus set. This structure is introduced in the publication:

> _Peter N Yianilos, Data structures and algorithms for nearest neighbor search in general metric spaces, In
Fourth annual ACM-SIAM symposium on Discrete algorithms. Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics Philadelphia, volume 93, pages 311â€“321, 1993._

The algorithm is based on a very simple idea: select a point as the vantage point, compute the distance of every point
to the vantage point and split the points according to the median distance, then recurse for left (inner) and right (outer) sub-array. For the splitting, we used _QuickSelect_ algorithm.

For the above construction process, there are two things to do in parallel:  
* compute the distances in parallel
* compute the inner and outer set in parallel

We ran benchmarks to compare times between different shared memory parallel implementations and sequential version. We ran the benchmarks on a dual-core processor (3GHz) with 4GB of DDR2 RAM, and the results show that we almost achieved the theoretical maximum acceleration (which is _x2_) in _pthreads_ and _cilk_. Times are reported in seconds. (N: # of points, D: # of dimensions).
